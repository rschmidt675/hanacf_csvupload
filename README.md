# hanacf_csvupload

This is a simple app which allows an user to directly update a table in HANA through CSV files.

It's an adaptation of the app that can be found here: https://answers.sap.com/questions/12853392/upload-csv-file-to-hana-xsa.html

These adaptations were necessary to make it work in the latest HANA Cloud Froundry update (Q2 July 2021).
